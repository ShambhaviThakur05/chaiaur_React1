1) useState - responsible for change in state amd propagates this change in the UI i.e DOM.
        it returns two value,therfore we take an array. and it takes one single default value.

        the value that it gives - the first value is the variable, and the next one is the method used to update the variable.


//      In this counter we want that the counter value should remain between 0 to 20 i.e 0<=counter<=20 so we have applied the if conditions accordingly.
